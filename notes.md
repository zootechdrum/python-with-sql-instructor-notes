 ### Quiz questions for week 2
 A very powerful statement in sql is the ```GROUP BY``` clause. This can be used with or without an aggregate function.
What must appear in the GROUP BY clause in order for it to work? What role does an aggregate function play when used with a GROUP BY clause?

What does the ```EXCEPT``` operator do ?
This EXCEPT operator example returns all product_id values that are in the products table and not in the inventory table. What this means is that if a product_id value existed in the products table and also existed in the inventory table, the product_id value would not appear in the EXCEPT query results.
